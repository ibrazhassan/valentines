            <p>For fourteen fortnights more,</p>
            <p>For the journey that is bright with light divine.</p>
            <p>And let the stars bear witness, solemnly they bow, and tides start rushing to the shore.</p>
            <p>For fate has whispered: Together shall we shine.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And the winter's hush, I see the birth of the falling snow,</p>
            <p>With each flake, a whisper, so delicate and rare.</p>
            <p>Yet none so perfect, none so bright,</p>
            <p>as though, it's thou who hath they long to mirror the grace.</p>
            <p>Yet match thee not, for thou art past compare...</p>
            <p>They trace thy elegance in frozen lace.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Vignettes of gardens, we envisioned, they'd bloom as time would weave,</p>
            <p>Yet in thoughts of mine, truth, so wondrous it'd grow,</p>
            <p>Thou art the garden, ineffable, it be,</p>
            <p>how my soul hath been set aglow.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And in the quiet of my heart, I find the truth unveiled,</p>
            <p>That thou art all I ever sought, though unaware, I roamed,</p>
            <p>Thy laughter, a melody that stirs my very core,</p>
            <p>Thy gaze, a harbor where my restless soul finds home.</p>
            <p>Thou hast shown me joy in its purest form,</p>
            <p>A happiness so vast, so rare, it seems a dream.</p>
            <p>How could one so perfect, so wondrously kind,</p>
            <p>Exist beyond the bounds of my most fervent hope?</p>
            <p>Yet here thou art, my miracle in flesh and grace,</p>
            <p>And with thee, eternity feels but a fleeting trace.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I dream of days where silver lines our hair,</p>
            <p>When time has etched its story on our skin.</p>
            <p>To build a life, a tapestry of memories,</p>
            <p>Where dreams, once whispered, now are woven in.</p>
            <p>Hand in hand, through sunlit fields and stormy skies,</p>
            <p>With thee, each moment, a treasure unsurpassed.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thus, let the seasons wane and moments soar,</p>
            <p>Till love doth reign,</p>
            <p>For fourteen fortnights more.</p>
